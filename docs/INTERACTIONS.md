# Interactions

## Interaction repairs · 2026-10-18

This pass fixes the eight audit findings within the adopted v6 identity. Existing
tokens, timing and page composition remain the reference; no dependency was added.

| Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Map zoom buttons reversed the camera distance | `map/engine.ts` uses reciprocal dolly factors | Plus enlarges the map; minus reduces it |
| Visit FAQ referred to the removed offline-save panel | `pages/VisitPage.tsx` explains online-only website reading and links to `/play` | Installation belongs to the independent game App |
| Selecting the current menu destination left the dialog open | `app/App.tsx` closes on ordinary menu-link activation, including secondary links | Modified clicks keep their native new-tab/window behavior |
| Dialog close always focused its opener | Dismissal restores the opener; navigation focuses main content | Route focus survives both same-page selection and lazy route loading |
| Storm read reduced motion only once | `motion/PetalStorm.tsx` uses a GSAP media context for both motion preferences | Preference changes remove the ticker, pointer listener and resize observer before drawing a still frame |
| News rotation continued during keyboard use | `components/HeadlineSwap.tsx` pauses for focus, pointer hover, manual toggle or offscreen state | A focused link stays available; leaving the region only resumes when manual pause is off |
| Roll's CSS text copy duplicated accessible names | `components/Roll.tsx` uses an explicit `aria-hidden` copy | Shared link labels are announced once |
| An unused burst component and styles remained | Removed the unreferenced component and exclusive CSS | The existing homepage storm owns the arrival burst |

Emil purpose: preserve reading position and immediate, predictable feedback. Checked
[Transitions.dev](https://transitions.dev/) modal open/close and text-state-swap
patterns; these corrections need no new transition. SEED → UNFOLD → BLOSSOM → FESTIVAL
continues to use the existing v6 presentation. Native dialog, link and button behavior
handles selection and pause states; CSS keeps the existing label roll.

GSAP remains justified only for the already adopted storm and headline choreography.
The storm's media context reverts its ScrollTrigger and removes its drawing callback;
the ticker's delayed swaps belong to its media context for cleanup on preference
changes or unmount. Reduced motion draws a still storm and shows the first headline
without a pause control. Mobile uses the same pause button and keyboard/focus rules;
no gesture-only controls or extra per-frame work were added. Taste/Hallmark review
keeps the sakura/pine tokens, typography and content-specific layout.

## Deployment split · 2026-10-17

The official website is a static GitHub Pages build. Install, offline-save and game
interactions now belong to the separate Docker PWA repository; historical inventories
below describe the previous combined app. Existing official-site visual/motion tokens
are preserved. Cross-site links use native anchors and existing button styles, without
new animation or dependencies. Consulted https://transitions.dev/ for component-state
patterns: this handoff needs no animated state transition. Reduced motion keeps the
same link behavior. Website JS no longer imports game/install modules; measurements
must be taken again before asserting any budget improvement. See ARCHITECTURE.md
and README.md for deployment and legacy-worker boundaries.

## Existing behavior

The 2026-09-29 greenfield inspection predates the implemented E2 Festival Web App.
For current behavior and verification, read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md),
[PROTOTYPE-NOTES.md](PROTOTYPE-NOTES.md) and [MAP-DATA.md](MAP-DATA.md).
This document defines permanent interaction policy. On 2026-10-17 the user replaced
v5 with v6 「櫻吹雪 · 一陣風」 (see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)); the inventory below is current.

### Current interaction inventory (v6, 2026-10-17)

Text motions follow ui.fearnot.tw's catalogue (numbers in brackets), one per context. Near
petals pass in front of the wordmark only; meta, actions and ledger sit above both canvases.

| Interaction | Source | Behaviour | Reduced motion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 櫻吹雪 storm | `motion/PetalStorm.tsx` | 44 (phone) or 100 flat petals on two canvases; on arrival they burst from the wordmark (櫻花爆開) and the wind takes them; pointer movement and scroll speed add gusts; GSAP ticker only while the hero is on screen | One still frame |
| Hero titles [33 空心字] | `inkFill` in `motion/gsap.ts` | Ink floods each outlined character left to right (clip-path, 1.1s, 0.12s stagger); meta, subtitle, actions and ledger drift in from the left (opacity + x) | Filled, static |
| 小副標 slogan | `HomePage.tsx` | The two-line slogan opens from each line's centre outward (clip-path, 1.2s, 0.35s apart), once; the story paragraph fades in after. Replaced the pinned 螢光筆 highlighter on 2026-10-17: the user found it janky and too large | Static |
| 松 [15 直書三層] | `HomePage.tsx` | Three vertical columns and the pine-cone glyph travel at different speeds with scroll (wide screens) | Static |
| 櫻 [35 圖案遮罩] | `HomePage.tsx` | Petals flow diagonally through the 櫻 glyph (background-position, 24s loop), only while it is on screen | Static texture |
| 即時導向 [25 翻牌] | `flap` in `motion/gsap.ts` | When the board arrives, each status riffles through characters to its value (ScrambleText, 0.15s apart); rows fill with sakura from the left on hover | Text static |
| 走進中央 [09 巨字滑過] | `HomePage.tsx` | Two giant lines cross the campus plate in opposite directions at different scrub speeds; the plate settles from 1.14; strokes draw in (CSS view timeline) | Static |
| 合作夥伴 [32 上下裂開] | `SplitSwap.tsx` | Every 2.4s the word splits (top up, bottom down) over the next one: 合作夥伴, 特約商店, 贊助單位 | First word only |
| Footer [13 緞帶] | `App.tsx`, `Ribbon.tsx`, `ShellMotion.tsx` | A full-width ink ribbon carries 松櫻祭・第二屆・國立中央大學・春日校園祭典 along a wave; `flowRibbon()` slides it by exactly one phrase per loop, only while the footer is on screen. The Ribbon is markup only so the shell loads no GSAP | Static |
| Inner-page heads [10 直書逆走] | `components/page.tsx`, `components.css` | Three outlined vertical columns of the page title flow up and down in turn (60s and 75s loops) beside the title; the title itself never animates, so pages switch without a flash | Static |
| Inner-page section titles [33] | `ShellMotion.tsx` | Ink fills each title as it arrives, only for titles that start below the fold | Static |
| 活動介紹 [14 跑馬燈] | `Bands.tsx` | Two stacked bands of categories and edition copy at different speeds and weights | Static |
| 關於我們 history [12 斜線帶] | `Bands.tsx` | Two bands of first-edition facts tilted against each other, running opposite ways | Static |
| 團隊成員 [16 封鎖膠帶] | `Bands.tsx` | The recruitment call as two crossing tapes above the call to join | Static |
| 合作單位 [39 雙色反轉] | `SplitInvert.tsx`, `PartnersPage.tsx` | 「成為合作夥伴」 in ink and sakura, split by a diagonal (`--split`) that GSAP scrubs across the words with scroll, swapping the colours | Split at 55% |
| 互動平台 [03 印章] | `stamp` in `motion/gsap.ts`, `PlayPage.tsx` | The three ways to collect (掃・答・拍) are pressed on as seals, 0.28s apart, when the list arrives | Static seals |
| 捐款 [37 液體填滿] | `DonatePage.tsx`, `pages.css` | The outlined 「支持」 fills with a sakura liquid (`public/art/liquid.svg`, background-clip) whose surface keeps moving; GSAP raises the level once on arrival. No figures: there is no channel or goal yet | Filled, still |
| 最新消息 [30 標題切換] | `HeadlineSwap.tsx` | A 快訊 ticker: every 3.2s the headline slides up and out and the next rises in; every headline is a real link, only the visible one is focusable (`inert`) | First headline |
| 來訪須知 [38 螢光筆] | `VisitPage.tsx` | A sakura highlighter runs under each caution (not following 2026 dates; the map cannot navigate) once it is read | Highlight shown |
| 404 [40 殘影] | `NotFoundPage.tsx`, `pages.css` | Three soft sakura echoes trail 「迷路了嗎」 and drift | Static echoes |
| 活動期程 | `ProgramPage.tsx` | No time animation (removed at the user's request, 2026-10-17) | Same |
| Page switches | `links.tsx` | Instant: no View Transition cross-fade and no title re-animation (removed 2026-10-17; the user found both jumpy) | Same |
| Header | `ShellMotion.tsx`, `shell.css` | Bar takes paper and a hairline after 80px; hides while scrolling down; emblem turns 720° across the page. Nav links: a rose underline draws in from the left on hover and wipes out to the right; the current page keeps it | Bar always on; underline without transition |
| Menu | `App.tsx`, `shell.css` | Sakura curtain drops (clip-path); labels rise from masks clipped vertically only, so the hover nudge never cuts a label; the destination's first character drifts in as an outline | 150ms fade |
| Buttons, links | `base.css` | Ink or rose wipes in from the left; label rolls; press 0.97; underline wipes out and back | Colour only |

**FLOW and catalogue record (2026-10-17).** The user asked for ui.fearnot.tw's FLOW group on
the footer and inner pages, then allowed any technique from the catalogue. FLOW: 09, 15
(home), 10, 12, 13, 14, 16; others: 03, 25, 30, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, each in one
place where its meaning fits.
Continuous loops are CSS transforms (or a GSAP `startOffset` tween for the ribbon) and run
only on composited layers; the footer wave is the one paint-based loop and is gated to
when the footer is visible.

**GSAP record (v6).** As v5, plus ScrambleTextPlugin for the board. Lesson recorded: never
tween `transform` on an element that also has a CSS `transition: transform` (the hero
buttons stuck at x −28px); tween a wrapper instead.

Transitions.dev was checked on 2026-10-16; patterns were re-implemented in CSS, not copied.
Its "Page side-by-side" idea informed the route transition, reduced to a cross-fade.
Checked again 2026-10-17 for the side-sheet menu: its "Modal open/close" recipe (named
transition properties, reduced-motion guard) matches the sheet, which keeps a drawer ease.

As features are defined and implemented, inventory each interaction with its route/component,
trigger, state change, feedback, keyboard/touch behavior, focus handling,
interruption/cleanup, reduced-motion behavior, and source path.

## Meaningful opportunities

These are conditional review prompts, not an implementation backlog:

| If the product includes… | Useful behavior to evaluate | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Async actions or forms | Immediate pending state, inline error and retry, clear completion | Prevent duplicate actions and support recovery |
| Menus or dialogs | Visible state, appropriate focus management, Escape dismissal and focus return | Preserve orientation and operability |
| Copy or other invisible effects | Concise accessible confirmation | Confirm an otherwise invisible outcome |
| Expandable content | Explicit expanded state and optional short transition | Explain the relationship between trigger and content |
| Drag operations | Clear destination feedback and non-drag alternative | Support direct manipulation and alternate input |

Use local visible feedback when it already communicates success; do not add a
toast to every action. Never invent a feature just to create an animation opportunity.

## Reference roles and permanent workflow

| Resource | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Taste | Visual quality, typography, composition and hierarchy |
| Hallmark | Identify generic / AI-generated website patterns |
| Emil | Interaction philosophy, purpose, timing and behavior |
| [Transitions.dev](https://transitions.dev/) | UI state-transition references and implementation patterns |
| GSAP | Complex choreography, timelines, scroll-driven animation and major 春空 sequences |
| Three.js / WebGL | Spatial / 3D experiences where DOM/CSS is insufficient |

Transitions.dev is a **motion reference and implementation resource**, not the
visual identity of 松櫻祭, a required runtime library, or a replacement for Emil's
purpose-first decisions. Its public catalogue includes menu, panel, accordion,
tab, icon, tooltip and loading-transition examples (checked 2026-09-30).
Consult relevant examples during future implementation/refinement; availability
of a recipe does not establish its suitability, accessibility or performance here.

For interactive UI:

1. **Purpose — Emil:** identify the state change, user task, frequency and what
   would be lost without motion. Keep an immediate state change when appropriate.
2. **Reference — Transitions.dev:** look for a relevant pattern; if none fits,
   proceed with the simplest suitable behavior rather than forcing a match.
3. **Adapt — Spring Sky:** translate the underlying behavior into the
   **SEED → UNFOLD → BLOSSOM → FESTIVAL** vocabulary and the 春空 visual system.
4. **Implement simply:** use CSS/native browser animation when sufficient.
5. **Escalate deliberately:** use GSAP only when choreography/timeline complexity
   justifies it; consult the implementation hierarchy below for intermediate needs.
6. **Reduced motion:** preserve states, information and actions without spatial motion.
7. **Performance:** check properties, layout, rendering cost, bundle impact and cleanup.
8. **Taste:** review visual consistency, hierarchy, scale, spacing and restraint.
9. **Hallmark:** reject generic effects, copied styling and repetitive animation.

### Applicable component contexts

Consult Transitions.dev for menu open/close, mobile navigation, dropdowns,
accordions, tabs, filters, expanding event details, announcement interactions,
state changes, icon transitions, buttons, tooltips, loading states, map information
panels, PWA UI states, small page-transition details and other component-level
transitions. This list defines where to consider the reference, not where motion
must be added. Component-level map panels do not require the 3D renderer to animate.

### Translation into the SEED → FESTIVAL vocabulary

Mapped onto 春空: SEED is the pine cone and closed states; UNFOLD is the sheet,
disclosure and language notice opening from their triggers; BLOSSOM is the hero
title and selected chip/location resolving; FESTIVAL is the triptych and the finite
falling petals.

Treat the vocabulary as a relationship between states: **SEED** is compact or
latent; **UNFOLD** reveals context from its trigger; **BLOSSOM** makes the active or
resolved state clear; **FESTIVAL** describes coordinated, broader storytelling.
Use the relevant relationship, not a mandatory four-stage animation on every
control. A menu might unfold from its trigger; a selected tab or completed PWA
save might resolve immediately into a clear active state. Do not invent literal
petals, a flower icon morph or celebration effects for every transition.

Adapt origin, direction, scale, duration, easing and interruption behavior to the
春空 Spring Sky language. Preserve semantic controls, immediate focus, keyboard and
touch operation, and honest async/error state. Never delay event information or
announce success before an operation actually completes. Small page transitions
must preserve history, focus and scroll behavior and never gate essential content.

For an adopted pattern, record its actual source URL, purpose, component/state,
adaptations, chosen implementation, reduced-motion equivalent and relevant test
results in the implementation notes. Do not assume example code's blur, bounce,
layout animation, dependencies or defaults are justified for this project.

## Motion principles

Apply Emil Kowalski's decision sequence: frequency, purpose, appropriate timing,
and interruption behavior. The default is no motion until a user benefit is clear.

- Animate to explain state, maintain spatial continuity, or acknowledge input.
- Frequent actions and keyboard-driven navigation should respond immediately.
- Keep focus indicators immediate. Never wait for animation before accepting input.
- Anchor popover motion to its trigger; keep movement small and directions coherent.
- Let repeated input interrupt or reverse a transition without queued effects or jumps.
- Prefer little or no bounce for functional UI. Physical gestures may justify a spring.

Starting ranges for future tuning, not observed values: press feedback 100–160 ms;
small popovers 125–200 ms; ordinary transitions 150–250 ms. Aim below 300 ms for
routine UI. Longer explanatory sequences require a documented user purpose.
Use a responsive ease-out for entry and a coherent ease-in-out for movement;
record shared easing tokens after a system is selected.

## Choosing the simplest suitable implementation

Preference hierarchy:

**CSS / browser-native transition → Transitions.dev pattern → Web Animations /
framework motion where appropriate → GSAP → Three.js / WebGL**.

Transitions.dev sits in this hierarchy as a reference/pattern step, not an engine
more complex than CSS. Use its principle with the simplest suitable technology;
there is no requirement to install a package, agent or skill from the site, reach
an external motion score, or pass through all tiers. This hierarchy guides cost
and purpose, not creative direction.

| Tool | Use when | Do not use merely for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native HTML / CSS | Simple states, hover/press/focus styling and short transitions | Replacing semantic controls with animation code |
| Transitions.dev reference | A relevant component-state pattern supports the task and can be adapted to 春空 | Importing a visual identity or adding motion everywhere |
| Web Animations API (WAAPI) | Programmatic playback/cancellation is needed beyond simple CSS | Adding an engine for a basic CSS state |
| Motion | An existing compatible app needs interruptible gestures, coordinated presence, or shared-layout transitions that justify a dependency | A fade, simple hover, or animating every component |
| GSAP | A real requirement calls for a complex timeline, precise multi-element choreography, major 春空 sequence or substantial scroll-driven explanation | Menus, button feedback, basic reveals or decorative scroll effects |
| Three.js / WebGL | A justified spatial / 3D experience cannot be adequately expressed with DOM/CSS | Component transitions, map information panels or decorative 3D novelty |

Use the project's existing capabilities first. A reference pattern does not
justify a new dependency; retain existing GSAP choreography where it serves its
purpose. Framework motion remains optional. Before introducing GSAP, record the user purpose, why simpler
tools are insufficient, affected components, bundle cost, cleanup strategy, mobile
fallback, and reduced-motion equivalent. Only then consult the relevant installed
GSAP core, timeline, ScrollTrigger, or framework skill. Do not load plugins by default.
Avoid multiple animation engines controlling the same element/property.

If GSAP is selected in a future implementation, apply the installed `gsap-core`
and `gsap-timeline` guidance: use a scoped timeline with labels and shared defaults
for sequencing instead of chains of arbitrary delays. Use `gsap.matchMedia()`
for responsive and reduced-motion branches, and revert its context on teardown.
Clean up non-GSAP listeners separately. Keep selectors within the owning component.
Do not use a zero-duration spatial timeline as a substitute for a considered static
layout. Consult framework-specific guidance when the stack is known. Libraries'
default durations or recommendations do not override this project's restraint rules.

## Animation constraints

Prefer transform and opacity; verify compositing in a performance trace rather
than assuming a library guarantees it. Specify transitioned properties explicitly;
avoid `transition: all`. Layout-affecting animation requires measured justification.
Do not hide essential or LCP content behind entrance animations or scroll triggers.
Clean up timelines, observers, listeners, timers, and animation frames on teardown.
Pause ongoing work offscreen and in hidden tabs. Follow [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md).

## Reduced-motion behavior

Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` in both CSS and JavaScript, including preference
changes during a session. Remove parallax, spatial reveals, scrubbed/pinned
sequences, continuous decorative motion, and smooth scrolling. Render the complete
static end state without waiting for a timeline. Preserve every function and piece
of information. An immediate change is preferred; a short opacity transition up
to 150 ms is acceptable when it improves comprehension.

Loading state must remain understandable with a static text/status alternative.
Do not rely on animation-end events for focus management, unlocking controls, or
essential state updates. Test reduced motion before and after component mounting.

## Input and accessibility

Provide native semantics, accessible names, logical tab order, and visible focus.
For modal dialogs, contain focus appropriately, prevent interaction with background
content, and return focus to the invoking control. Keep status announcements
concise. All applicable interactions must work with keyboard and touch, not hover
alone. Gate decorative hover effects to hover-capable fine pointers. Preserve
native scrolling, browser history, selection, and zoom.

## Interactions that should not be added

Do not blindly copy every Transitions.dev recipe, add motion to every component,
or use a transition solely because it looks impressive. GSAP is not currently a
dependency; reintroduce it only under the documented choreography test below.

No scroll hijacking, mandatory animated intros, custom cursor replacements,
unbounded autoplaying decorative loops (finite ambience that stops, as above, is the
documented exception), magnetic controls, indiscriminate parallax,
letter-by-letter essential copy reveals, or routine page-wide stagger effects.
Do not add auto-rotating content, sounds, particles, or 3D backgrounds without a
specific product need. No delayed focus, gesture-only actions, or content that
remains invisible when JavaScript or an animation library fails.

## Verification

Exercise repeated clicks, rapid reversal, keyboard input, touch, escape/cancel,
slow requests, errors, reduced motion, route changes, and component teardown as
applicable. Inspect timing at normal speed and slower playback. Record actual
results and device limitations in the relevant implementation notes. Adding this
workflow resource does not itself constitute new application testing.
